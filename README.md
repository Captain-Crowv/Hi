Hello>:D My name is Spidey/Spider. Feel free to call me anything you like. I don't mind!

My gender is unknown, it can be female or male. Whatever you like! I like to draw sometimes, It's my talent. I can't afford to buy a paint so I decided to use pencil or pen!

Don't have a good day! have a great day!:D

to int w me, You should introduce yourself to me so I can introduce myself to you. I don't interact much because I'm afraid to speak up sometimes or approach, but only if I have the guts to do so.

it's best to whisper to me because I might be busy chatting with others at my party! I'm a shy type but also a talkative one on the inside, so be kind to me so you can able to be my friend!

I take notes to know my friends the most. sometimes I struggle to remember, but I'm slightly good if they introduce themselves properly!

I have a lot of interest, and I can tell it to you if I'm very comfortable^-^ I have Discord, but you must have to ask first:)
I have games that I know slightly. you also have to ask my username!

I don't mind whatever you call me or my gender. I keep my gender hidden.<3

U^ェ^U: >< That's it for now! thank you for reaching all this way. feel free to int with me if you're comfortable ><

☆♡>Stay safe, my brothers and sisters<♡☆
